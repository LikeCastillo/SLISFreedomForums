We built this project in order to give the community of UP SLIS a portal to share their thoughts and manifestations with each other. Perhaps they want to let something out any though related to LIS. They can register, login, and post their tweet-like articles about anything as the website neatly collects everything.

In this project we have learned much about web development in Flask using Python, CSS, HTML, and basic SQL. We've used the lessons we initially learned in the LIS 161 Resources and Corey Schafer's Python Flask Tutorial.

FUNCTIONALITIES:

- Users can enter a record that will be stored in a database (Posts)
- Users must be able to edit their posts and save them
- They can see the published posts of all other users
- They can delete the posts they have written
- At least three data types are managed by the system
- Users need to have their input validated input (Registration Parameters, Post length requirements)
- The System recognizes those who have and have not registered for the website
= Only registered users can reach the 'Account' page, and they're the ones who can only do CRUD on the system
- System is viewable on different devices

- System is accessible op
Tools used for this project
- Flask (including WTforms that helps record user input upon registration, validators, flask_login to login, datetime)
- SQAlchemy and SQLite(to assist us in managing SQL Databases, would not need anymore to open SQLite to directly edit the db)
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library in handling profile pictures)
